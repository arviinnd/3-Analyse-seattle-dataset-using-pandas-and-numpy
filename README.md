Respected everyone, this is my third repository. This is a dataframe giving information on snowfall, maximum temperature and 
minimum temperature in Seattle for different days. The mean snowfall, maximum temperature and minimum temperature are -54, 
170 and 87 respectively. There are 17 columns in the dataframe. The maximum Temperaturemaximum is 356 and the minimum 
temperature minimum is -60. The notebook also has plots of Maximum Temperature and Minimum Temperature vs days at the end.
